## Recommendation
The recommended pricing strategy for new developers is 3.40 $. To gain acceptance, 
it's advisable to offer a free version initially before transitioning to a paid model.
The 3.40 $ price point was chosen as it reflects the average cost of paid games.
-------------------------------------------------------------
The recommended genres for new developers is Simulation, Strategy, Action, Puzzle.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Am think there is no correlation between genre, game size
-------------------------------------------------------------
I found over 9400 rows in this data that didn't have a rate and number of rates,
so I hide this data to get a correct result after that,
the total games I worked on were 7561 games
-------------------------------------------------------------
I assume that all users who rated these paid games are the ones who spent money on these games.
